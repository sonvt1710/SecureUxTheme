# SecureUxTheme

## About

SecureUxTheme is a software that removes signature verification of styles from Windows.

## Features

* No system file modifications
* No driver needed
* Secure boot compatible
* Probably quite future-proof

## Limitations

Styles must still have a format-wise valid signature appended, it is just not verified. A tool for fixing styles without or with invalid one is included in the installer.

## Operating System Support

* Windows 10 1903 (tested)
* Built with support for Windows 7 and later (not tested)

## Download

[Latest release](https://github.com/namazso/SecureUxTheme/releases/latest/download/SecureUxTheme_setup.exe)

## Building

### Requirements

* Visual Studio 2017 (newer ones not tested)

### Compiling

1. Open SecureUxTheme.sln and click __Build Solution__ on x64/Release and Win32/Release settings
